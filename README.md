# Earliest-Deadline-First-EDF-Scheduler-using-FreeRTOS-

Implemented an Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) Scheduler using FreeRTOS, following the guidelines
outlined in the thesis "Implementation and Test of EDF in FreeRTOS." Evaluated the functionality of the
implementation using a logic analyzer within the Keil IDE. Additionally, assessed the schedulability of the
system using the Simso simulator.
